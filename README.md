# Stock-Analysis-Using-Python
 Stock Analysis Project
 This project focuses on analyzing stock data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis is divided into three parts: Returns Analysis, Volume Analysis, and Technical Analysis. Below are the details of the tasks performed in each part of the analysis.

# Part 1: Returns Analysis
# Tasks:
# Price History Timespan:

# Determined the start and end dates for the price history of the stocks. All stocks share the same timespan, so the dates were determined for one stock.
# Line Plot of Adj. Close Prices:

# Created a line plot showing the Adjusted Close prices over the last 5 years for all the stocks in the portfolio, displayed together on the same plot with a legend.
# Stock Percent Change Calculation:

# Developed a function that takes in the Adjusted Close price series and calculates the stock's percent rise or decline from any set of given dates.
# Histogram of Daily Returns:

# Created a histogram of the daily returns for each stock in the portfolio.
# Value of $10,000 Investment in BAC:

# Plotted the value of a $10,000 investment in BAC (approximately 701 shares) at the start of the time series and showed how the value would have changed throughout the time period, resulting in approximately $28,773 at the end.
# Annualized Sharpe Ratios:

# Calculated the Annualized Sharpe Ratios for each stock in the portfolio.
# Part 2: Volume Analysis
# Tasks:
# Daily Volume Plot:

# Created a plot showing the daily volume of stock traded over the time period of 5 years.
# Total Dollar Amount Traded Plot:

# Created a similar plot as the daily volume plot, but reflecting the total dollar amount traded. This took into account the Adjusted Close price as the consensus price for each day.
# Highest Dollar Value Traded:

# Determined which stock had the highest dollar value amount traded on a single day, identified the date, and investigated if any significant events occurred around that time for the company.
# Part 3: Technical Analysis
#Tasks:
# 60-Day Moving Average Plot:

# Using BAC stock, created a plot showing the Adjusted Close Price along with the 60-day moving average of the price on the same plot.
# Bollinger Bands:

# Created Bollinger Bands to visualize the stock's price volatility.
