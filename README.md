# Stock-Analysis-Project
 This project focuses on analyzing stock data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis is divided into three parts: Returns Analysis, Volume Analysis, and Technical Analysis. Below are the details of the tasks performed in each part of the analysis.

## Part 1: Returns Analysis
### Tasks:
1. <b>Price History Timespan:</b> Determined the start and end dates for the price history of the stocks. All stocks share the same timespan, so the dates were determined for one stock. <br>
2. <b>Line Plot of Adj. Close Prices:</b> Created a line plot showing the Adjusted Close prices over the last 5 years for all the stocks in the portfolio, displayed together on the same plot with a legend.
3. <b>Stock Percent Change Calculation:</b> Created a line plot showing the Adjusted Close prices over the last 5 years for all the stocks in the portfolio, displayed together on the same plot with a legend.
4. <b>Histogram of Daily Returns:</b> Created a histogram of the daily returns for each stock in the portfolio.
5. <b>Value of $10,000 Investment in BAC:</b> Plotted the value of a $10,000 investment in BAC (approximately 701 shares) at the start of the time series and showed how the value would have changed throughout the time period, resulting in approximately $28,773 at the end.
6. <b>Annualized Sharpe Ratios:</b> Calculated the Annualized Sharpe Ratios for each stock in the portfolio.

## Part 2: Volume Analysis
### Tasks:
1. <b>Daily Volume Plot:</b> Created a plot showing the daily volume of stock traded over the time period of 5 years.
2. <b>Total Dollar Amount Traded Plot:</b> Created a plot similar to the daily volume plot, reflecting the total dollar amount traded. This considered the Adjusted Close price as the consensus price for each day.
3. <b>Highest Dollar Value Traded:</b> Determined which stock had the highest dollar value amount traded on a single day, identified the date, and investigated if any significant events occurred around that time for the company.

## Part 3: Technical Analysis
### Tasks:
1. <b>60-Day Moving Average Plot:</b> Using BAC(Bank Of America) stock, created a plot showing the Adjusted Close Price and the 60-day moving average of the price on the same plot.
2. <b>Bollinger Bands:</b> Created Bollinger Bands to visualize the stock's price volatility.
